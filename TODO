{add,remove}-child-{add,remove}-class
JS library that allows adding classes to elements to respond to various events. e.g.

on-mutation-child-add-class
on-mutation-attribute-add-class
...

on-scroll-up-start-add-class
on-scroll-up-start-remove-class
...

on-intersect-enter-any-add-class
on-intersect-enter-top-add-class
...

JS library to implement parallax-group and parallax-layer classes 

- separate components into own repo and publish as npm-package(s). Behavioral components separate fom content components.
- update/fix broken component demos
- add white-space: nowrap; to autofit-font-nowrap component. Perhaps add max-width: 100% and max-height 100%;
- change MutationObserverHTML element to be query-selector based and support attributes like:
  - {add,remove}-child-{add,remove}-class
  - {add,remove/change}-attribute-{add,remove}-class
- create query-selector based ResizeObseverHTMLElement
  - {resize,shrink,grow}-{add,remove}-class
- finish control sizer implementation in form-Control
- component for scroll edge fading
- component for setting common attributes via query selector
- make component for circle using clip path

Completed
- consistency for nav-point/section sizing method.
- fix form validity polyfill
- cleanup on-scroll and add support for scroll-{start/stop}-{up,right,down-left}-{add/remove}-class
- make on-intersection-add-class more powerful
  - {enter, leave}-{top, right, left, bottom}-{add, remove}-class
- separate rather than inherited class for autofit-font-queryselector
- use autofit-font-query-selector for vertical-timeline and other elements that should have guaranteed consistent font size across all children
- use window resize event to adjust font sizes i.e. give autofit-font window-resize or resize-observer mode.
- Use requestAnimationFrame for components making significant style changes in constructor
- mobile scaling (nesting nav bar in particular)
- text compression webpack plugin
- favicon
- element-internals-polyfill patch not working up in production build in Firefox
- cleanup use of vh and vw units
- fix nav-bar in firefox android
- create progress-bar-container that allows centering on highest completion percentage using a resizeObserver to recalculate the width of each progress-bar relative to the container.
- allow control over one-shot behavior for form-control-submit-mixin
 - The submit animation was removed from the component altogether. An event now fires on submit which allows for custom behavior to be defined externally.
- rename on-intersect-add-class to on-intersection-set-class

- clean up content and header box shadow
- suppress outline when tabbing to submit
- border color consistency
- label font in form a bit too small?
- different color for vertical timeline dates
- make small font size the default
- fix strip of white space on left of window. The width of the vertical scrollbar caused parallax layers to be translated slightly in the +x-direction.
- fix extra overflow at bottom of page due to parallax background layer.

8/20/2021
- progress bar animation in Firefox
- fixed issue where progress-bar centering failed if viewport was resized before progress bars came into view
-fixed extra vertical scroll height in on-scroll container due to use of vh rather than % units
Abandoned:
- scroll snap components
- center child components
- show header only on section change
