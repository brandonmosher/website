Pending
- progress bar animation in Firefox
- transfer domain to route 53
- add white-space: nowrap; to autofit-font-nowrap component. Perhaps add max-width: 100% and max-height 100%;
- text compression webpack plugin
- rename on-intersect-add-class
- Change MutationObserverHTML element to be query-selector based and support attributes like:
  - {add,remove}-child-{add,remove}-class
  - {add,remove/change}-attibute-{add,remove}-class
- Separate component into own repo and publish as npm-package(s). Behavioral components separate fom content components.
- Create query-selector based ResizeObseverHTMLElement
  - {resize,shrink,grow}-{add,remove}-class
- Create progress-bar-container that allows centering on highest completion percentage using a resizeObserver to recalculate the width of each progress-bar relative to the container.
- Control sizer in form-Control

Completed
- fix form validity polyfill
- Cleanup on-scroll and add support for scroll-{start/stop}-{up,right,down-left}-{add/remove}-class
- make on-intersection-add-class more powerful
  - {enter, leave}-{top, right, left, bottom}-{add, remove}-class
- separate rather than inherited class for autofit-font-queryselector
- use autofit-font-query-selector for vertical-timeline and other elements that should have guaranteed consistent font size across all children
- use window resize event to adjust font sizes i.e. give autofit-font window-resize or resize-observer mode.
- Use requestAnimationFrame for components making significant style changes in constructor
- mobile scaling (nesting nav bar in particular)

Abandoned:
- scroll snap components
- center child components
- show header only on section change
